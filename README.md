Summary: Using HTML and CSS, create a simple tribute website which passes the given tests.  That is, the 1) page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements; 2) should have an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page; 3) should have a div element with a corresponding id="img-div"; 4) within that img-div element, should have an img element with a corresponding id="image" and 5) a second element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown; should have an element with the id="tribute-info", which contains textual content; 7) should have an element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page; 8) the img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size, and 9) should be centered within its parent element.

Reflection:  This was my second HTML/CSS project, and gave me another good opportunity to work with flexbox, in particular.  Though I was able to complete the task with relative ease, it still took some trial and error to make things work across a variety of platforms.  If I decide to pursue front-end development, I would want to study flexbox and the various properties involved with responsive design in more detail to be more comfortable with them.
